        <h1>Why Learn Linux?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          The field of Information Technology (IT) is full of opportunities. For individuals who
          wish to pursue a career in IT, one of the biggest challenges can be deciding how to get
          started. Often, people are motivated to learn new skills that will enable them to pursue
          bigger and better opportunities in both their personal and professional lives. Learning a
          new skill takes time and discipline, but with the right motivation, it doesn’t have to be
          painful. In this section, we will discuss why the time and effort you invest in learning
          Linux will be beneficial to you; and remember, everyone working in IT had to start
          somewhere.

          Learning Linux is a great way to start! Why is Linux an important skill to learn in
          today’s technology-driven world?
        </p>
        <br />
        <b>What is Linux?</b>
        <br /> 
        <br />
        <p>
          Before we determine what makes Linux such a great asset to your skill-set, let’s define it
          first. Linux is operating system software that runs on a hardware computer system. An
          operating system is software that allows other programs like word processors and web
          browsers to be installed and run on a computer. Your cell phone, tablet, laptop and
          desktop all need an operating system to run the software (often called applications) you
          want to use. This means that Linux is not limited to only desktops and laptops, and we
          will expand on that as we continue our discussion. The main reason why learning Linux is
          useful is that Linux is used almost everywhere! Linux is used on desktop and laptop
          computers, web servers, mobile devices (Android), public cloud technology (i.e., Google,
          Amazon, etc), Chromebooks, and networking (i.e., Cisco Networks). Although you may not
          have ever used Linux on a desktop or laptop, it is likely that you are using other
          technology that runs on Linux such as a mobile phone running Android, a tablet or popular
          websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon. In fact, it is estimated that servers
          running Linux generate over half of the web pages on the internet.
        </p>
        <br />
        <b>Who can use Linux?</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          You may have heard of Linux and thought that only technologically advanced individuals are
          using it for programming, developing, or maybe even hacking! Although it is true that many
          techies use Linux, that doesn’t mean Linux is too difficult to learn or isn’t useful for
          beginners. In fact, understanding Linux, especially the Linux command line interface, will
          help you understand computing better while giving you basic computing skills that you can
          use in a future career.
